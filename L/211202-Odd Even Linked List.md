Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return *the reordered list*.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == `number of nodes in the linked list
- `0 <= n <= 104`
- `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`

#### First Approach:

O(n) time complexity

O(1) extra space

```python
def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next: return head
    odd = head
    even = even_head = head.next
    while even and even.next:
        odd.next = even.next
        odd = odd.next
        even.next = odd.next
        even = even.next
    odd.next = even_head
    return head  
```
