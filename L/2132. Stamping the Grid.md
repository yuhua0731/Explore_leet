You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied).

You are then given stamps of size `stampHeight x stampWidth`. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given **restrictions** and **requirements**:

1. Cover all the **empty** cells.
2. Do not cover any of the **occupied** cells.
3. We can put as **many** stamps as we want.
4. Stamps can **overlap** with each other.
5. Stamps are not allowed to be **rotated**.
6. Stamps must stay completely **inside** the grid.

Return `true` *if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return* `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/ex1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], stampHeight = 4, stampWidth = 3
Output: true
Explanation: We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image) that are able to cover all the empty cells.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/ex2.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]], stampHeight = 2, stampWidth = 2 
Output: false 
Explanation: There is no way to fit the stamps onto all the empty cells without the stamps going outside the grid.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[r].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10 ** 5`
- `1 <= m * n <= 2 * 10 ** 5`
- `grid[r][c]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `1 <= stampHeight, stampWidth <= 10 ** 5`

#### Discussion Approach(accumulate 2d)

- Prerequest question: `304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable`

- Let the height and width of the stamp be `h` and `w`, and the height and width of the grid be `H` and `W`.

- First, go through every **empty** cell and check if it can be as the right bottom corner of a stamp.

  - Let the cell we are checking be `(x, y)`

    (The list is 0-based). Then it can be a valid right bottom corner of a stamp if the following requirements are satisfied:

    - `x >= h - 1 and y >= w - 1`. Otherwise, the stamp may be pasted outside the grid.

    - There are no occupied cells in `grid[x-h+1][y-w+1] ~ grid[x][y]`.

      > to check if all cells are empty in `grid[x-h+1][y-w+1] ~ grid[x][y]`, we can refer to the above question 304. If subRegion has a sum of 0, then all cells are empty.

    - For example, if `h = w = 2` then the valid right bottom corners will look like:

- Second, go through the **empty** cells and check if they are all covered by stamps.

  - Let the cell we are checking be `(x, y)`. Then the cell is covered by stamps if there are valid bottom right corners in `grid[x][y] ~ grid[min(x+h-1, H)][min(y+w-1, W)]`.
  - For example, if we are checking the cell `(0, 2)` (the cell with orange triangle) then it is covered by stamps placed on the cell `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)`.
