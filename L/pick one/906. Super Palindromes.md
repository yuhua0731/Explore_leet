Let's say a positive integer is a **super-palindrome** if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Given two positive integers `left` and `right` represented as strings, return *the number of **super-palindromes** integers in the inclusive range* `[left, right]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: left = "4", right = "1000"
Output: 4
Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: left = "1", right = "2"
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18`
- `left` and `right` consist of only digits.
- `left` and `right` cannot have leading zeros.
- `left` and `right` represent integers in the range `[1, 10 ** 18 - 1]`.
- `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

#### Intuition

> instead of setting the range of superpalindrome, we could convert left and right into the range of base palindrome, inclusively.
>
> - `left = math.ceil(math.sqrt(int(left)))`
> - `right = math.floor(math.sqrt(int(right)))`
>
> by doing this, we decreased our iterate complexity from `O(10 ** 18)` to `O(10 ** 9)`.
>

> however, this time complexity if not acceptable either. Then we find another trick, except for the 1-digit number, if there is any 3+ digit in number `i`, it will cause `i ** 2` failed to be a palindrome.

>
> - if 3 is at the center position of an odd-length number, let’s take 131 as an example. this 3 must be surrounded by other numbers(0, 1 or 2).
>   - if other digits in this number is all 0, then this number is 3, which is a base palindrome of a super-palindrome.
>   - if there is any non-zero digit in the number, the center production result 3 * 3 = 9 will have to be added with non-zero numbers, that will also cause an increment to its following digit, and then break the rule of a palindrome.
>   - hence, we could draw the conclusion that except for 3, all base palindromes of super-palindromes can only be formed by 0, 1, 2.
>
> now we decrease our time complexity to `O(3 ** 9)`, which is definitely acceptable for this question.
