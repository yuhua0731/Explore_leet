We want to split a group of `n` people (labeled from `1` to `n`) into two groups of **any size**. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer `n` and the array `dislikes` where `dislikes[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that the person labeled `ai` does not like the person labeled `bi`, return `true` *if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4] and group2 [2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `0 <= dislikes.length <= 10 ** 4`
- `dislikes[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= n`
- `ai < bi`
- All the pairs of `dislikes` are **unique**.

#### My approach

brute force

1. iterate dislike pairs
2. create two dictionaries, one record the group index of each people, the other record the dislike pairs between all groups
3. if there exist a dislike pair that they are already in the same group, then we cannot split them apart, return False
4. if we do not encounter any conflict, return True at the end

```python
def possibleBipartition(self, n: int, dislikes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    group = dict()
    dislike = dict()
    for i, j in dislikes:
        if i not in group and j not in group:
            # encounter two new people that has not been seem before
            dislike[i] = j
            dislike[j] = i
            group[i] = i
            group[j] = j
        elif i in group and j not in group:
            group[j] = dislike[group[i]]
        elif i not in group and j in group:
            group[i] = dislike[group[j]]
        else:
            # both can be found be group
            gi, gj = group[i], group[j]
            if gi == gj: return False
            if dislike[gi] == gj: continue
            else:
                # move (gj, dislike[gj]) to (dislike[gi], gi)
                for i, g in group.items():
                    if g == gj:
                        group[i] = dislike[gi]
                    elif g == dislike[gj]:
                        group[i] = gi
    return True
```
