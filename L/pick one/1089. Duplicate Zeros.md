Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`

```python
def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
    """duplicate zeros in list and shift elements to right
    Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
    """
    dq = collections.deque()
    for i, v in enumerate(arr):
        dq.append(v)
        arr[i] = dq.popleft()
        if v == 0:
            dq.append(0)
```
