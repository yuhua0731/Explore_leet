You have `n` gardens, labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `paths` where `paths[i] = [xi, yi]` describes a ==bidirectional== path between garden `xi` to garden `yi`. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return ***any** such a choice as an array* `answer`*, where* `answer[i]` *is the type of flower planted in the* `(i+1)th` *garden. The flower types are denoted* `1`*,* `2`*,* `3`*, or* `4`*. It is guaranteed an answer exists.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10 ** 4`
- `0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10 ** 4`
- `paths[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= xi, yi <= n`
- `xi != yi`
- Every garden has **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.

> 🍀 since there are at most 3 paths coming into or leaving each node, there will always left an available color to be chosen

```python
def gardenNoAdj(self, n: int, paths: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    # adjacent painting
    # greedy?
    graph = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for i, j in paths:
        graph[i].add(j)
        graph[j].add(i)
    ret = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        neighbor = set(ret[j] for j in graph[i])
        for c in range(1, 5):
            if c not in neighbor: 
                ret[i] = c
                break
    return ret[1:]
```
