Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](image_backup/111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree/ex_depth.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 105]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

#### My approach

since we only need to find the minimum depth, BFS seems a suitable choice to implement.

once we encounter a node with bigger depth than the recorded one, we just prune it and all its children.

```python
def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
    """find the minimum depth of a binary tree

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): the root node of this tree

    Returns:
        int: the minimum depth of this tree
    """
    if not root: return 0
    curr = [[1, root]]
    ans = float('inf')
    while curr:
        depth, node = curr.pop(0)
        if depth >= ans: continue
        else:
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                ans = min(ans, depth)
            else:
                if node.left: curr.append([depth + 1, node.left])
                if node.right: curr.append([depth + 1, node.right])
    return ans
```
