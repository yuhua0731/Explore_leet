### 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

 

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

```python
def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
    return bin(n).count('1')
```

### 1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer

Given an integer number `n`, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 234
Output: 15 
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
Result = 24 - 9 = 15
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4421
Output: 21
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 
Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11 
Result = 32 - 11 = 21
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

```python
def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
    prod, s = 1, 0
    while n:
        i = n % 10
        prod *= i
        s += i
        n //= 10
    return prod - s
```
