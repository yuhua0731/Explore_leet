In this explore card, we're going to go over the basics of **DP**, provide you with a framework for solving DP problems, learn about common patterns, and walk through many examples.

No prior knowledge of DP is required for this card, but you will need a solid understanding of recursion, a basic understanding of what greedy algorithms are, and general knowledge such as big O and hash tables. If you aren't familiar with recursion yet, check out the [recursion explore card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/) first.
