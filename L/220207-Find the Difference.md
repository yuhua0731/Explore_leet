You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

```python
def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
    s = collections.Counter(s)
    for i in t:
        if i not in s or s[i] == 0: return i
        s[i] -= 1
```
