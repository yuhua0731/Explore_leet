Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](image_backup/559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree/narytreeexample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

![img](image_backup/559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree/sample_4_964.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The total number of nodes is in the range `[0, 10 ** 4]`.
- The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

#### My approach

simple recursion

```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
        
def maxDepth(self, root: 'Node') -> int:
    def depth(node):
        if not node: return 0
        return 1 + max([0] + [depth(c) for c in node.children])
    return depth(root)
```
