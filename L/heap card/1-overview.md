In many computer science applications, we only need to access the **largest** or **smallest** element in the dataset. We do not care about the order of other data in the data set. How do we efficiently access the largest or smallest element in the current dataset? The answer would be **Heap**.

In this Explore Card, we will introduce **Heap**. After reading this section, you will,

Have a better understanding of the “Heap” data structure and its implementation;

Have a better understanding of the concepts and methods of **Max Heap** and **Min Heap**;

Have a better understanding of **Heap Sort**;

Have a better understanding of the application scenarios of “Heap”;

Be able to use “Heap” in practice.
